1.
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

2.
bockground-size:cover;

	Resize the background image to cover the entire container, even if it has to stretch the image or cut a little bit off one of the edges
    3.
    a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content.

    4.
    The display: inline-block Value
Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

5.
The :nth-child(n) selector matches every element that is the nth child of its parent.
n can be a number, a keyword (odd or even), or a formula (like an + b).
